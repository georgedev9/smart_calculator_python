This is the *Smart Calculator* project I made myself.

Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about lists, strings, and other data types. You will also get a closer experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue.

Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one yourself and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.

This project does the following tasks:

* Your calculator is taking its first steps: teach it to calculate the sum of two integers and display the result on the screen.
* Enable your calculator to keep adding numbers in a loop until the user enters “exit”.
* Using lists and strings, make it possible to calculate sums of multiple integers.
* Where there is a plus, there is a minus. Using your knowledge of lists and strings, enable the calculator to deal with subtraction as well as addition.
* There’s no math without errors: teach your program to alert the user to errors in the case of invalid input.
* Working with dict, enable the calculator to use variables.
* Time to upgrade and add even more possible operations: multiplication, division, powers, and calculations in parentheses.
